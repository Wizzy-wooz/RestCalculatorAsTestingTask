# RestCalculator

Create the web application in Java which meets the following criteria:

* The web application should offer an REST-like API interface (HTTP/JSON) for simple arithmetic calculations.

* The API offers an operation which accepts a list of numbers, does some calculations and returns calculation result.

Calculation result is always a single number.

It should be defined in configuration how the calculations are done.

It is up to you to define how the configuration looks like.


For example, if the inputs are `X1` and `X2`, the calculation could be `X1 + 5*X2/X1`.
